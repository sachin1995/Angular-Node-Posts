# Angular-Node-Posts
Application to signup/login/create/modify/delete posts, saving into db using MongoDB.
Here u will find two zipped folders:
  * App.zip : this contains all the services/ components/ interceptors.
  * Backend.zip : This will contain all the NodeJS / Express / Models from Mongoose files which works on the backend.
  
Thanks
